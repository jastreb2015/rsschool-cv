## Code Example

### Description

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

### Examples

```
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"

```

### Notes

* All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
* There will always be at least one number in the input string.
* Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

### Solution

```
function highAndLow(numbers) {
    numArr = numbers.split(' ').sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return numArr.length > 1 ? `${numArr.pop()} ${numArr.shift()}` : `${numArr[0]} ${numArr[0]}`
}
```
